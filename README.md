# About
Etherpad lite is a really-real time collaborative editor spawned from the Hell fire of Etherpad. 
We're reusing the well tested Etherpad easysync library to make it really realtime. Etherpad Lite 
is based on node.js what makes it much leigther and more stable than the original Etherpad. Our hope 
is that this will encourage more users to install a realtime collaborative editor. A smaller and well 
documented codebase makes it easier for developers to improve the code

# Why use Etherpad Lite?
* Tiny server hardware footprint
* Pure Javascript client and server side
* No nasty dependancies

* Easy to embed

# What isn't available YET when compared to Etherpad?
* Timeslider
* Import/Export
* Clear authorship colours
* Upload files
* View Saved revisions
* Chat
* Pad management
* User management
* Plugin framework
